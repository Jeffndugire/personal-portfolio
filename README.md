## 📖 About This Project  
This is my personal portfolio website featuring an **interactive secret code puzzle**. The puzzle requires visitors to enter a special year that changed everything for me. If they guess correctly, they unlock a hidden message:  

✨ `"I love coding ❤️"`  

This puzzle represents **my journey in programming**, as it reflects the year I truly fell in love with coding and started building projects like this!
